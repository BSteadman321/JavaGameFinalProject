                        RULES:  Klondike Solitaire

        Requires 1 player and a standard 52 deck of cards.
        The objective is to organize a shuffled deck of cards into
        4 stacks(one of each suit) in ascending order(Aces are low).
        There are 7 cards at the bottom of the screen, called the
        tableau, in here face up cards can be transferred in descending
        order and in alternating color. The player must transfer the
        top card or stack of cards to any pile in an attempt to create a
        sequence of descending values and alternating colors. An empty
        slot in the tableau can only be filled with a King. If the player
        cannot move any more cards in the tableau, then a card can be
        selected from the draw pile.

        The goal is to build up the foundation stacks. The top card of
        the table or draw pile can be transferred to the foundations.
        When all of the cards have been transferred in ascending order
        (Ace up to King) to the foundations the game is won! If no moves
        can be made and the foundations are still incomplete, the game
        is lost."

        Hard Mode: When the game is in hard mode the player can only flip
        through the draw deck once.

        Easy Mode: When the game is in easy mode the player can flip through
        the draw deck as many times as they want.
