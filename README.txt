Rule set: 

	Basic rule set depending on the mode selection:

	Easy mode:
		Normal rules for solitare, cards in piles must be one value less and the opposite color to stack, 
		the draw deck deals one at a time and you can play that card dealt anywhere on the board,
		the aces must be stacked in order from ace to king and when it has completed one pile the ace pile is flipped,
		when the draw deck is empty the user clicks the restart button and the play deck is flipped back to the draw deck,
		only kings can go to an empty pile (but they can take as many cards with them as they want),
		win condition is getting all ace piles full from ace to king.
		Restart button takes the user back to the main menu where they can select the game mode.

	Hard mode:
		Same rules as Easy mode with one exception:
			The draw deck cannot be reset after the player has gone through all the cards.
			once the draw deck is empty, the player must try and win the game with the assets on the board.
			Not for the feint of heart!



How to use interface:
	The game starts on a menu where the game difficulty is selected, and the player selects one to start the game.
	The player can then play the game until victory or until they would like to reset the game. To reset the game, press the help menu dropdown and select reset game. This will return the player to the game mode selection where this process can repeat. 

Description of extra features:
	The split of easy and hard mode as described above is the extra feature we have added to the game. Hard mode is for the more experienced and determined player so we gave the user an option of their difficulty selection.


Work split:

Bret Steadman and William Spearman: The two of us got together most weekdays to work on the project and as a result the entire project 
was done in person with an equal work split 50/50 for both of us.
